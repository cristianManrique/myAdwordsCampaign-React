## Explain solution
- I choose React.js to create this web app. It's easy and faster.
- I choose react-chartjs-2 to display charts. It's animated, customisable, approved with html5 canvas.
- For the first chart, i display a Doughnut chart for each keyword with a summary of world (clicks, conversions and impressions).
- For the second chart, i display a Line for each keyword because we have to manny datas to display.
